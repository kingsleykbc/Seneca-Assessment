A video of how the component should work is attached.

The link to the figma project is here which has designs that can help you:

### Requirements, please:

- State any assumptions or limitations of your solution in the repository readme - ✅
- Put your soluton in git repo & email the link once you are done - ✅
- Some form of type checking should be used e.g. flow, propTypes, typescript - ✅
- The component should be responsive down to 320px - ✅
- The solution should lock once the correct answer is reached so the toggles can no longer be switched - ✅
- Ignore the navbar or footer just the toggles component itself - ✅
- The toggles should animate between the two states (see attached video) - ✅
- The background color should change in proportion to how "correct" the answer is (see video attached) - ✅
- The component should be reusable & extendable, it should be able to accomodate the question changing from that in the video to e.g: - ✅

Q. "What are the ideal conditions inside an office?"
A. (good pay, bad pay) (lot of meetings, less meetings), (free coffee, expensive coffee), (bear in office, dog in office).

Extension:

- The order of the questions & answer positions should be randomised - ✅
- You solution should be able to accomodate answers with both two and three toggle positions in the answers. For example: - ✅
  Q. "Which are the best sports people & teams?"
  A. (Liverpool, Chelsea, Man Utd), (Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka)
- You should make it easy to switch between the active question - ✅
